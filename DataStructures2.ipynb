        "##### #Ans.Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.In simple terms they help manage data in a logical and structured way.Common data structures include lists,tuples,dictionaries and sets each serving different purposes in handling information.For example,a list is great for storing ordered items,while a dictionary helps pair keys with values for quick lookups.Understanding data structures is important because they directly impact the performance of your programs,especially when working with large amounts of data.They're a fundamental part of data analysis,programming and computer science overall."
